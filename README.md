### How to run dev server

Prerequisites:
- You need mongodb up and running locally. The simplest way would be to start docker mongodb image
- Create `.env` file based on `.env-example` (for localhost MONGO_DB_URI might be `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`)

To install dev dependecies run these commands within project folder:
```sh
# install the dependencies of the Node.js server
npm install

# install the dependencies of the frontend
npm run client-install
```

Finally, all you have to do is simply run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

If this command fails, try installing the package [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) globally by running `npm install -g concurrently` and then running the `dev` command.

You can have this application up and running with just a few steps because it has both the frontend and the backend in a single repository. Follow the steps below to do so.
